mostly used for my rapid prototyping on ds platform
didnt recommended to use this

please just use built-in gl2d from libnds instead
https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/docs/libnds/gl2d_8h.html

nasirebus note:

this is actually gl2d wrapper library from sillysagiri called PPX
i got the permission to publish it on github and make my own changes

special thanks for sillysagiri (https://git.sillysagiri.moe)
who wrotes like 80% of the code and allow me to use this
